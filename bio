Hello everybody!

After a week of thinking, I finally decided to pull up some info on my journey in ROBLOX!

Building - I started to build back in 2013. Free models only (I think that's how we all started).
      But I quickly learned that hand built models are visually better so decided to pull myself back together
      and I stopped using Free Models forever. I still gather them though, but I do not use them (with exception
      of playgrounds). I started to develop my building skill tree and today, I'm a descent builder!
      
Scripting - So I was developing my first huge project, but I faced problems, HUGE problems. I didn't knew how to script.
      So, I thought why not learning how to script? And here my "School" begins. After a month I quickly learned what
      word means what in the scripting, and then finally I can code prety well!
      
GUI - I started to get involved with GUIs somewhere back in early 2014. I liked the shape, so I started experimenting.
      There's not really anything much to say, but I can say one thing - scripting does expand your GUI experience!
      
Some other stuff about me:
- Available for hire
- I never leave my work unfinished
- Tried to apply to RBXDev, but failed with low scripting and building exp. back in 2014.
- Is looking for a dev team
- Friendly
- I'm extrovert.
